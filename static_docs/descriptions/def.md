# Def

[Read this documentation in the browser](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp/blob/main/static_docs/descriptions/def.md)

In Ruby, a method is defined using the `def` keyword. The method definition ends with the `end` keyword. A standard method definition for a method named `foo` is as follows:

def foo
puts "bar"
end

foo

# => bar

Alternatively, there is an `end`-less syntax introduced in Ruby 3.0:

def foo = puts "bar"

foo

# => bar

```ruby

```
